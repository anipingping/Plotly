## Purpose of this project
This website contains information on bacteria collected from the bellybuttons of volunteers. A visitor to this website can select different voluteer ID numbers to see what type of bacteria were obtained from the bellybutton, what amounts, and how often the volunteer washes their naval. These charts are interactive and will change as a visitor to the website adjusts the User ID number. Have fun exploring bellybutton biodiversity!
